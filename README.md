 In today’s digital world, people deal with huge amounts of information in the form of long 
documents and videos. Reading or watching everything takes a lot of time and effort. Our 
project aims to solve this problem by building an AI-based system that can automatically 
summarize documents and videos using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
 This system will help users quickly understand the main points of the content without going 
through the entire text or video. It will support both extractive and abstractive summarization 
and provide fast, accurate, and easy-to-read summaries for better decision-making and 
learning.
